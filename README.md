# MaralGPT Inference Tools

_MaralGPT_ is a _Larage Language Model_ project launched in middle of the year 2023 by Iranian entrepreneur and engineer [Muhammadreza Haghiri](https://haghiri75.com/en) as an attempt to improve the AI for Persian language and also it is a part of [Mann-E](https://manne.ir) project.

## Dataset

1. The _mistral_ version is trained on [Alpaca Persian](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sinarashidi/alpaca-persian), thanks to Sina Rashidi who translated the Alpaca dataset to Persian.

## Considerations

* Alpaca Persian is translated using a machine. So the results may be a little off. Please consider this while using the model.
